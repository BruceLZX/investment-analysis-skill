# Company Deep-Dive Playbook

Use this playbook for every company analysis. It raises the mandatory depth standard from "coverage" to "forensic detail." Every section must answer the deepening questions below. When information is unavailable, state it explicitly and explain what data would be needed and how it affects confidence.

This playbook is mandatory for all company types. For public equities, some sections (equity structure, financials) will have richer data sources; for early-stage startups, some sections will require more effort to source.

## The Granularity Benchmark

Professional investment analysis is defined by **specificity**, not length. A 200-page report that uses vague language is worse than a 50-page report where every claim has a number attached. The following standards are non-negotiable:

### Numbers Must Be Precise
- ❌ "approximately 45%" → ✅ "43.1373%" or "43.1%" (state source and confidence)
- ❌ "hundreds of patents" → ✅ "69 granted patents + 12 pending across US/CN/EP"
- ❌ "founded in 2023" → ✅ "2023年10月15日" or "2023年10月"
- ❌ "raised several hundred million" → ✅ "$75M Series B at $450M pre-money (2025-03-15)"
- ❌ "large facility" → ✅ "16,000平方米，含二类/三类有源医疗器械GMP厂房"

### People Must Be Traceable
- ❌ "毕业于知名大学" → ✅ "本科 中国科学技术大学 机械电子工程；硕士 香港理工大学 软件工程"
- ❌ "曾在多家公司工作" → ✅ each role: company + title + dates + specific achievements
- ❌ "行业资深人士" → ✅ "69篇同行评审论文；曾任职于Neuralink担任临床合作负责人"
- Every founder bio must trace from undergraduate through highest degree
- Every key hire must have: institution + degree + year + prior employer + role + achievements

### Events Must Be Dated
- ❌ "recently completed funding" → ✅ "2026年6月26日，超级工厂一期竣工投运"
- ❌ "has partnerships with hospitals" → ✅ "与上海华山医院、上海市精神卫生中心、华西医院共建联合实验室"
- ❌ "attended by investors" → ✅ "华映资本季薇、清松资本张松、戈壁创投唐啟波、傅利叶顾捷出席剪彩"

### If Data Is Unavailable
- State EXACTLY what is missing (e.g., "注册资本未公开" not "信息不足")
- Explain how material the gap is to the investment decision
- List what source would resolve it (e.g., "需查阅工商登记档案")
- NEVER fill the gap with vague language that sounds informative but conveys no data

## Section 1: Company Overview — Forensic Identity

### 1.1 Legal Entity Map

Map every legal entity in the corporate structure. This is not optional — investors must know exactly which entity they are investing in.

| Entity | Jurisdiction | Entity Type | Role | Ownership % | Ultimate Controller |
|--------|-------------|-------------|------|-------------|---------------------|
| [Holding Co] | Cayman/BVI | Ltd | IPO vehicle / top holding | 100% (top) | Founder(s) |
| [HK Co] | Hong Kong | Ltd | Intermediate holding | 100% by Holding Co | — |
| [WFOE] | Shanghai, China | 外商独资企业 | VIE anchor / operating license holder | 100% by HK Co | — |
| [VIE OpCo] | Beijing, China | 内资有限公司 | Operating entity (holds ICP, licenses) | VIE controlled | Nominee shareholders |
| [Subsidiary 1] | [Location] | [Type] | R&D center | X% | — |
| [Subsidiary 2] | [Location] | [Type] | Sales entity | X% | — |

**Mandatory:**
- Distinguish VIE vs. non-VIE vs. red-chip architecture
- Identify which entity holds key licenses/assets/IP
- Flag nominee shareholder arrangements, contractual control gaps, and enforceability risk
- For public companies: specify listing venue, ticker, exchange, currency, shares outstanding, free float %

**If VIE architecture:**
- Who are the nominee shareholders? What is their relationship to the founder?
- What contracts bind the VIE (exclusive option, proxy, equity pledge, exclusive business cooperation)?
- Has any PRC court or arbitrator ruled on the enforceability of these specific VIE contracts?
- What happens to the VIE if the nominee shareholder dies, divorces, or goes bankrupt?

### 1.2 Complete Timeline

Build a timeline with **specific dates** (YYYY-MM or YYYY-MM-DD when available). Do not use "recently," "currently," or "soon."

| Date | Event | Significance | Source |
|------|-------|-------------|--------|
| YYYY-MM | Company founded by [Founder] at [Location] | Origin | [SX] |
| YYYY-MM | First product launched: [Product Name] | Product proof | [SX] |
| YYYY-MM | Series A: $X million at $Y valuation, led by [Investor] | Financing milestone | [SX] |
| YYYY-MM | Key hire: [Name] joined as [Role] from [Prior Company] | Team building | [SX] |
| YYYY-MM | FDA/CE/NMPA submission: [Product/Indication] | Regulatory milestone | [SX] |
| YYYY-MM | First paying customer / pilot launch | Commercial validation | [SX] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Minimum:** 8-15 dated milestones covering founding, product, financing, team, regulatory, commercial, and strategic events.

### 1.3 Equity & Cap Table

Build the most accurate cap table possible. Differentiate between **confirmed** (from filings, company disclosures) and **estimated** (from media, industry inference).

| Shareholder | Class | Shares | % Ownership | % Voting Rights | Investment Cost | Current Value (at latest round) | Return Multiple |
|-------------|-------|--------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------------------------|-----------------|
| Founder A | Ordinary / B-class (10:1) | X | ~45% | ~71% | $X | $X | Xx |
| Founder B | Ordinary | X | ~15% | ~12% | $X | $X | Xx |
| Investor 1 (Sequoia) | Preferred A | X | ~20% | ~8% | $X | $X | Xx |
| Investor 2 (Lightspeed) | Preferred B | X | ~10% | ~4% | $X | $X | Xx |
| ESOP (undistributed) | — | X | ~10% | 0% | — | $X | — |
| **Total** | | | **100%** | **100%** | | | |

**Mandatory:**
- **Share class breakdown**: ordinary vs. preferred, voting vs. non-voting, vested vs. unvested
- **Super-voting rights**: any founder with >50% voting power despite minority equity? Detail the mechanism.
- **Liquidation preferences**: multiple (1x, 1.5x, 2x), participating vs. non-participating, seniority stack
- **Anti-dilution**: full ratchet vs. weighted average
- **ESOP**: total pool size, allocated vs. unallocated, annual refresh rate
- **Drag-along / tag-along / ROFR / co-sale**: which investors have these rights?
- **Redemption rights**: any put options or mandatory redemption triggers?
- **Board seats**: who holds them? Founder-controlled, investor-controlled, or independent majority?
- **Protective provisions / veto rights**: what decisions require investor consent?

**If information is unavailable:** State which items are unknown and how material they are. For a pre-IPO company, the absence of liquidation preference data is highly material.

## Section 3: Technology & IP — Patent-Level Detail

### 3.1 Core Technology Inventory — Academic-Level Deep Dive

**This is the most important section of the report.** Professional investment teams spend >40% of their research time on technology depth. The technology section must read like a well-researched survey paper, not a marketing brochure.

#### 3.1.1 Technology Mechanism — How It Actually Works

For EACH core technology, explain the mechanism in accessible but technically precise language. The reader should understand the underlying physics/biology/chemistry, not just what the product does.

**Mandatory structure for each technology:**

```
### Technology: [Name]

**1. Mechanism of Action (MOA) — The Physics/Biology**
[Explain in 5-10 sentences the underlying scientific principle. Use the actual physics/biology terms.
e.g., NOT "ultrasound stimulates the brain" BUT "经颅聚焦超声(tFUS)通过相控阵换能器发射多束超声波，
在颅内特定位置形成干涉焦点，产生机械力效应(非热效应)调控神经元膜电位。焦点尺寸~2-3mm³，
空间分辨率达亚毫米级别，可穿透完整颅骨，无需开颅手术。"]

**2. Key Performance Metrics**
| Metric | Value | Measurement Method | Source |
|--------|-------|-------------------|--------|
| Spatial resolution | 亚毫米级(~0.5mm) | [How measured] | [Paper/Source] |
| Temporal resolution | 0.5-1.5s延迟 | [How measured] | [Paper/Source] |
| Brain coverage | 25%全脑体积 | [How measured] | [Paper/Source] |

**3. Academic & Clinical Evidence**
- Key papers: [Author(s), Title, Journal, Year, DOI if available]
- Total relevant publications in this field: [N] papers on PubMed
- Key finding 1: [What the seminal paper proved]
- Key finding 2: [What the most recent breakthrough is]
- Clinical evidence level: [Animal studies / First-in-human / RCT Phase I/II/III]

**4. Competitive Technical Approaches (Same Mechanism Level)**
For EACH major competing technical approach, provide the SAME level of mechanism detail:

| Technical Dimension | Our Technology | Neuralink (electrode) | Synchron (stentrode) | Blackrock (Utah array) |
|---------------------|---------------|----------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Physical principle | [e.g., 超声波机械效应] | [e.g., 微电极记录电场] | [e.g., 血管内电极] | [e.g., 硬膜外电极阵列] |
| Invasiveness | 非侵入(经颅) | 侵入(开颅植入) | 半侵入(血管介入) | 侵入(开颅植入) |
| Channel count | [N] (等效) | 1024 | 16-128 | 96-256 |
| Brain coverage | 25%全脑 | 1.3‰皮层 | 局部血管周围 | 1-2mm²皮层 |
| Spatial resolution | 亚毫米 | 单神经元(50μm) | 毫米级 | 微米级(单神经元) |
| Signal type | 血流间接(代谢) | 电场直接(电生理) | 电场直接(电生理) | 电场直接(电生理) |
| Surgical requirement | 无 | 开颅手术 | 血管介入手术 | 开颅手术 |
| FDA/NMPA status | [Status] | FDA HDE 2024 | FDA IDE 2023 | FDA IDE 2017 |

**5. Technology Evolution & Roadmap**
- Generation 1: [Current capability, year achieved]
- Generation 2: [Next milestone, target year]
- Generation 3: [Long-term vision, target year]
- Key bottleneck to overcome: [The single hardest unsolved problem]
- Who else is trying to solve it: [Research groups, competitors, open-source projects]

**6. Key Debates in the Field**
- Debate 1: [e.g., 侵入式 vs 非侵入式 — 哪个路线最终胜出？]
  - Pro-invasive argument: [with evidence]
  - Pro-noninvasive argument: [with evidence]
  - Our assessment: [which is more likely and why]
- Debate 2: [Another major controversy in the field]

**7. Academic Literature Search Protocol**
For technology companies, the analyst MUST:
- Search PubMed/Google Scholar for: "[technology name] mechanism", "[technology name] clinical", "[technology name] review"
- Search arXiv for: "[technology name]" (for AI/engineering)
- Open and read at least 3-5 key papers' abstracts; 1-2 full papers for the most important ones
- Cite at least 2 specific papers with author, title, journal, year
- Compare company's claimed metrics against published literature benchmarks
```

#### 3.1.2 Technology Moat Assessment

Go beyond "strong IP" and analyze WHY the technology is hard to replicate:

```
**Replication Difficulty Assessment:**

| Barrier | Difficulty (1-10) | Why | Time to Replicate (Est.) |
|---------|------------------|-----|-------------------------|
| Scientific/Physics barrier | [X] | [Explanation — what law of physics or biology makes this hard] | — |
| Engineering barrier | [X] | [Explanation — what manufacturing/integration challenge exists] | [X] years |
| Data barrier | [X] | [Explanation — what proprietary data is needed] | [X] years |
| Regulatory barrier | [X] | [Explanation — what certification/approval creates moat] | [X] years |
| Ecosystem barrier | [X] | [Explanation — what partner/customer lock-in exists] | [X] years |
| **Composite Moat Score** | **[X]/10** | | **Minimum [X] years of lead time** |
```

**The replication test:** "If a well-funded team of 50 world-class engineers and scientists were given unlimited resources and all of this company's published patents, how long would it take them to build a competitive product?" This is the most honest measure of technology moat.

### 3.2 Patent Portfolio

Build a patent table with as much specificity as possible:

| Patent/App # | Title | Type | Jurisdiction | Filing Date | Grant Date | Expiry | Legal Status | Relevance |
|-------------|-------|------|-------------|-------------|------------|--------|-------------|----------|
